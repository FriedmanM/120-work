## Proposal for Final Project

Proposal
---
For my project I would like to create a working PONG game in P5.js.
I briefly created a sample of this for my Project 7 (I think).
Obviously I am inspired by Ted Dabney, creator of PONG.

Issues
---
I will need to resolve issues with making the cube interact with the paddles, a scoreboard, and a way to refresh the game after its over.

Plan
---
I have already begun working on solutions for the issues mentioned above.
My goal is to have a prototype working next week (Weds). I will then iron out any issues and formatting to get it submitted by Monday (Dec 10th).

So far I have been discovering solutions for the scoreboard and page refresh. I have the working base from the first project to go off, and using my new knowledge from hw-12, I will make the ball interact with the paddles.
