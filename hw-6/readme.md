## This week in Review:
This week I learned about **making even more things MOVE!**, **mapping, random numbers, mathematics, variables**, and awesome new functions to make art more advanced. I really enjoyed things getting more complex, although it was a little overwhelming all the possibilities.

## Steps to Complete
I followed along the steps for this week, making sure to fully complete each one.
* Built the folders/files for hw-5
* Finished lesson on GitHub.
* Learned more advanced javascript.
* Took a long time to even figure out what my vision for this assigment was.
* Finally got it together and coded the whole thing in one blast.
* Finished the assignment and prepped for submission.

## Issues
I didn't really have any issues, besides trying to figure out what I wanted to draw. I had enough time to plan out and create my artwork this week.

## Learning
I really like how many functions and tools there are available to me to use in P5.js. I think it is amazing how much you can manipulate shapes. I can't wait to see what else I can do with P5.js!
