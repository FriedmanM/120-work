["While and For Loop Sketch](https://friedmanm.github.io/120-work/hw-8/)
---

## This week in Review:
This week I learned about **using FOR and WHILE loops in Javascript**. It is extremely similar to what I've learned in Programming in C. I did not have any problem picking it up in Javascript.

## Steps to Complete
I followed along the steps for this week, making sure to fully complete each one.
* Built the folders/files for hw-8
* Finished lesson on GitHub.
* Learned how loops are used in P5.
* Built a few projects but scrapped them.
* Played around an idea and got it working.
* Finished the assignment and prepped for submission.

## Issues
I didn't really have any issues this week. I already have a good amount of knowlege in looping, so I didn't struggle at all.

## Learning
I've enjoyed playing around with similar ideas in both C and Javascript. It continues to amaze me how most programming languages use the same or similar language to make things happen.
