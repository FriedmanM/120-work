["Arrays and Functions"](https://friedmanm.github.io/120-work/hw-10/)
---

## This week in Review:
This week and last week I learned about **arrays and custom functions**. It is extremely similar to what I've learned in Programming in C. I did not have any problem picking it up in Javascript.

## Steps to Complete
I followed along the steps for this week, making sure to fully complete each one.
* Built the folders/files for hw-10
* Finished lesson on GitHub.
* Learned how to use arrays and custom user functions in P5.
* Got frustrated because I seem to always make colored squares.
* Made another colored square sketch.
* Finished the assignment and prepped for submission.

## Issues
The only issues I seem to have is coming up with original ideas that are not random squares and random colors. I really need to open my art chakra or something.

## Learning
I like the concept of arrays, and have enjoyed being able to clean up my code by using functions. It's great for both testing the code and for cleaning up the main file.
