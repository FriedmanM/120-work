## This week in Review:
This week and last week I learned about **Making objects interact**. This is something I have been wondering about since starting this class. I think I already have an idea of what I want to do.

## Steps to Complete
I followed along the steps for this week, making sure to fully complete each one.
* Built the folders/files for hw-12
* Finished lesson on GitHub.
* Learned how to make objects interact with each other.
* Came up with an idea I want to use.
* Started programming.
* Finished the assignment and prepped for submission.

## Issues
So I was unable to get my Link to interact with the balls. I could not make the balls delete when Link runs into them. :(

## Learning
I enjoyed learning about making separate files to clean up the main code. I really like having the ability to make objects interact, and can't wait to built my final with what I have in mind.
