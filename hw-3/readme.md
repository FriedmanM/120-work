["Hello World!" Sketch](https://https://friedmanm.github.io/120-work/hw-3/)
---

## This week in Review:
This week I learned about the basic procedure when building sketch.js files, as well as the index.html files that display them on a browser.

## Steps to Complete
I followed along the steps for this week, making sure to fully complete each one.
* I created a sample *'01_Hello-World'* project,
* I used the **example folder** structure to build out hw-3
* I learned some basic functions in Java, which are surprisingly similar to C/C++ functions.
* I made my homework repo websites host on GitHub.

## Issues
I did not experience any issues this week.

## Learning
As someone that already has some programming experience, I still definitely learned some things this week. One of the most important things I've learned is the fact that **Java** and **C/C++** are similar languages, giving me hope that I will be able to learn these two, as well as **Python**, very easily. I also learned that my previous webdev experience will assist me later when/if we need to make changes to **index.html** files.
