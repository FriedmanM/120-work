## This week in Review:
This week I learned about **drawing**, **shapes**, and some **Javascript functions** for making *cool 2D images*!

## Steps to Complete
I followed along the steps for this week, making sure to fully complete each one.
* Built the folders/files for hw-4
* Finished lesson on GitHub.
* Learned about arcs, lines, points, triangles, stroke, and more.
* Finished the assignment and prepped for submission.

## Issues
I did not experience any issues this week.

## Learning
I really liked the ability to mold shapes in ways I could never imagine via scripting. It was great that you can create a rectangle on a specified point, create all sides, and even dictate the corners (90 degree or round)! I thoroughly enjoyed playing around with java to create a work of art (haha ok its not really a work of art). I can't wait to learn some 3D things!!!
