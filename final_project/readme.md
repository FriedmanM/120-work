## Final Review

## Steps to Complete
I built my program by the following:
* Planned my time unwisely
* Got stuck in Hamilton all day and had no cell service or internet (a Charter technician broke a fiber line)
* Finished project at 11:48 PM

## Issues
I ran into a time crunch issue this week. I had to work in Hamilton for the past 3 days. I had been working on and building my program, but I did not have internet until I got home tonight at 10:00. I added my finishing touches and submitted.

## Learning
I am very thankful for everything I have learned in this class. I really showed my skills in making this program. I hope you enjoy it!
