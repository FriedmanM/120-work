## This week in Review:
This week I learned about **making things MOVE!**, **mouse cursors/positions**, and some **MORE Javascript functions** for making my art POP!

## Steps to Complete
I followed along the steps for this week, making sure to fully complete each one.
* Built the folders/files for hw-5
* Finished lesson on GitHub.
* Learned about mouse cursor positions, using rotation, variables, and more.
* Finished the assignment and prepped for submission.

## Issues
I ran into a time crunch issue this week. I had to work in Spokane for 3 days, which put a large strain on the amount of time I had to complete the project. I wish I had some more time to add some working features, like a working scoreboard or making the ball bounce off paddles.

## Learning
I think that learning how to move objects is the beginning of the fun part of P5.js. I am super excited for what comes next, as I think this can make your artwork more conceptual, more entertaining, and add new life.
