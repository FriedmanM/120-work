["Object Oriented Programming"](https://friedmanm.github.io/120-work/hw-11/)

## This week in Review:
This week and last week I learned about **Object Oriented Programming**. I am actually starting to learn this in C++ right now, so it was interesting learning about it in *P5.js* at the same time.

## Steps to Complete
I followed along the steps for this week, making sure to fully complete each one.
* Built the folders/files for hw-11
* Finished lesson on GitHub.
* Learned how to create classes, objects, and how to assign and use them.
* Got frustrated because I seem to always make colored squares...
* Tried to make something new...
* Made another colored square sketch... Stick to what you're good at I guess.
* Finished the assignment and prepped for submission.

## Issues
Well... what can I say. Here's another colored square sketch. I have an art block, and can only imagine colored squares. I dream of them. I think about them 24/7. I'm becoming a colored square. SEND HELP!

## Learning
I like utilizing objects and classes. It makes code a lot cleaner and easier to read. It can make tons of lines of code fit into a much smaller package. Great lesson!
